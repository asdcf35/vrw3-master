          Kyle is a great fit to be our candidate. He speaks clearly and
          confidently and gets the point across. <br/><br/>Kyle is from the streets of
          Sugar Creek, North Carolina. Growing up his family was below the
          poverty line and unfortunately split and that resulted in him being
          from a broken home. <br/><br/>He has learned to battle through financial and
          behavioral hardships. This makes him a fearless leader learning to
          navigate through a world that may have seemed against him from the
          start. Kyle is very compassionate throughout his works and he loves
          helping throughout the community to lead other children who may or may
          not have been through the same difficulties he has to prove that no
          matter your background things will work out in the end.
